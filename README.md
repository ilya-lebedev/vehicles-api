# Vehicles API

This is my project from "Web Services and APIs" course of "Java Web Developer Nanodegree Program" in Udacity.

In this project I implemented a Vehicles API using Java and Spring Boot
that can communicate with separate location and pricing services.

## Instructions

Check each component to see its details and instructions. Note that all three applications
should be running at once for full operation. Further instructions are available in the classroom.

- [Vehicles API](vehicles-api/README.md)
- [Pricing Service](pricing-service/README.md)
- [Eureka Service](eureka/README.md)
- [Boogle Maps](boogle-maps/README.md)

## Dependencies

The project requires the use of Maven and Spring Boot, along with Java 11.
